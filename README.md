# NBA-Fortune
NBA Fortune is a fully coded gaming app created by Amie Deng, Brian Lin, Gary Wang, Shane Wang. This app allows users to trade NBA player stocks with virtual currency using real-time data. The purpose of this app is to engage existing NBA basketball fans and sports investors. Sports betting has become increasingly widespread since its legalization in the United States, and the idea of NBA Fortune is born out of this rising trend.

The main functions of this app allow users to have an investment portfolio that displays purchased player stocks, buy and sell functions that complete transactions of players, and a search function for current NBA players in a database that displays game statistics. 

Data and game statistics of the NBA players were gathered using an API from MySportsFeed. The real time news were pulled from NBAâ€™s official RSS reader. Additionally, a separate back end server was needed to store updated information for users and in-game currency. Firebase was used to implement user authentication for login and registration.
